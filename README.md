# Edwyt

A simple lightweight text editor for learning about GUI and Python

I am hoping to build this from scrach over time, Ideas and help would be well recieved.

To do List:

1) Edit the save function so that it is not nesecary to save as every time.
2) Edit the help dialog box to give some help.
3) Make sure it doesn't overwirte an already open file when opening another.
4) Remove the known bugs from the program (see change log)
