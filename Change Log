CHANGE LOG



+++ VERSION 0.1.0 - 10/08/2016 +++

CHANGES

First release of the program, so no changes to report.

KNOWN BUGS

Some unusual behaviour (least I don't know why it does it) with reports of 'ScrolledText' object has no attribute 'write' as it displays the text in the text area when open function is run.
